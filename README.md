Experiments in voice conversion and speaker dimensions.

# Demonstrate FreeVC with Deep-Speaker embedding trained on Globe sample dataset

This demnstration shows how a voice conversion system can be trained to be drived by acoustic parameters or by principal components of those acoustic parameters.

In this demonstration, the FreeVC package is trained to performa voice conversion of speech audio using speaker embeddings computed by the deep-speaker package.
